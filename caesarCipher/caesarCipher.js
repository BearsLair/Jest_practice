// 1. Split() word into array
// 2. Map() through each character
//      a. Using character codes and the given key, replace character
//          with the correct character based on the given key (character code number is increased by the key)
//      b. If character is at end of the alphabet (i.e. "z"), counting should
//          wrap around to beginning of alphabet, and should keep same case (upper or lower).
//      c. Symbols should be untouched (i.e. "-", "_", "&", "$", etc.)
// 3. Return joined array (into single string) of the shifted characters.
